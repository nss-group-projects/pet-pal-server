## Getting Started

üìù If you are on a Mac and are running AirPlay, it defaults to port 5000, which is what this API will run on. Disable AirPlay while running the API.

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the project to the directory of your choice, and then:

```sh
cd pet-pal-server
```

### Setting Up the Database

1. Create a connection string user secret. Remember to modify it by putting your password in there before running the commands.
   ```sh
   dotnet user-secrets init
   dotnet user-secrets set 'ConnectionStrings:PetPalDbConnectionString' 'Host=localhost;Port=5432;Username=postgres;Password=your_password;Database=PetPal'
   ```

2. Apply the database migrations:
   ```sh
   cd PetPal.API
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

### Running the API

There is a `launch.json` and `tasks.json` file already in the repostitory, so you can immediately start the program in debug mode.
